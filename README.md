Dad Jokes App was created mainly for me to practice fetching data from API. To do this I used axios combined with async, await. The main objective has been accomplished and although the app still requires some additional styling -- especially for smaller devices -- the functionality is there. 

If intreasted in the outcome, please head to ➡️ https://dadjokes-4c28f.firebaseapp.com/ ⬅️ and check my app out!
